## What is Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)

The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic optimization problem where a salesman must visit a set of cities exactly once and return to the starting city, minimizing the total travel distance or cost. It’s an NP-hard problem, meaning there’s no efficient solution for large datasets. Exact methods like brute force and dynamic programming work for small cases, while heuristics and approximation algorithms like genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, and nearest neighbor are used for larger instances. TSP has practical applications in logistics, manufacturing, and network design.
